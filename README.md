# Sparse Matrix Operations

## Overview

This project offers a Python solution for efficient sparse matrix operations using a dictionary of dictionaries (DoD) structure. By focusing on sparse matrices—where most elements are zero—it minimizes memory usage by storing only non-zero values. This approach provides both flexibility and speed, optimizing performance compared to traditional dense matrix representations.
